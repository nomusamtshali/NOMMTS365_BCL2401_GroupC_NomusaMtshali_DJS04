# DJS04 Project Brief: Book Connect - Web Components

# Project Overview

Building upon your "Book Connect" project in DJS03, you will now dive into Web Components. This challenge will refine your skills in creating reusable, encapsulated, and interactive elements.

# Project Brief

1. **Understand the Existing Codebase**: Familiarise yourself with the current structure and functionality of the "Book Connect" project, focusing on the book preview feature.
2. **Create a Web Component for Book Preview**:
   - Encapsulate the book preview into a Web Component.
   - Ensure that the component is self-contained, with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Test the component to ensure it works seamlessly within the app.
3. **Identify and Convert Other Components**:
   - Analyse the application to identify other potential components for conversion.
   - Prioritise components based on their reusability and importance to the app.
   - Convert the chosen elements into Web Components.
4. **Testing and Integration**:
   - Rigorously test the new components individually and within the context of the application.
   - Pay special attention to interactions between components and the overall user experience.
5. **Documentation**:
   - Document the process of creating the Web Components.
   - Include any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
   - Provide a clear guide on how the components should be used within the app.

# Elements included

- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

# Reflections

### Areas of mastery

- There were definitely no areas of mastery within this project, I still need to go back and relearn the whole section of web components

### Challenges faced

- Web components were very difficult to understand and this made the process of coding slow and unpleasant.

### Areas of Improvement

- Understanding of web components. I need to improve my understanding of web components, as I found it difficult to grasp the concept and apply it in the project. I think with more resources I'll be able to understand the concept.

## Overall learning experience

- Throughout this project I faced many challenges with comprehending the brief and what web components actually are, as mentioned above, the process of coding was slow and unpleasant, this was also reflected in the overall learning experience. Due to being tired and frustrated at not finding the solutions, my ability to learn in an agile way diminished and the overall learning experience left much to be desired.
